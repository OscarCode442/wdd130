        <h3>WE OFFER HELP TOO</h3>
        <p>
          If you are unable to find what you need online, or have made a mistake with your booking that you don't want to be charged for, you can also easily find the contact phone number you need. Reach a Customer Service Executive who can offer advice on the booking conditions. If need be, they can also reach out to the property to ask questions on your behalf.
  
          You can also easily change the language you are viewing the website in, or the currency the accommodation is displayed as. We really like the friendly reminders of the currency you will need to pay the property in so that if you change your website view to your own currency whilst you are searching (to help you understand the cost better), you are far less likely to forget to check the actual amount you will pay to the property in their currency.
